# NFTRainbow The Rainbow Bridge for NFTs 🌈🌉🦄

NFTRainbow is a rainbow bridge for NFTs: a One-Stop, Simple and Developer-Friendly NFT Infrastructure & APIs to help developers bring their NFT applications to market in hours instead of months. We take care of the NFT infrastructure so you can focus on your application. Built by developers for developers.

## Developing NFT Applications used to be Hard, Slow and Expensive 🤯

### Blockchain stack is complex 🤔

Grasping Solidity, Web3.js, GraphQL, nodes, IPFS, data-intensive applications, etc. is hard, time-consuming and usually needs a team to cover all of the skills.

### Setting up and maintaining blockchain infra is like selecting the nightmare difficulty in Doom 👹

Teams waste 25-50% of engineering resources managing nodes, developing NFT indexers, doing DevOps, etc. Going multi-chain only compounds that because it usually takes 3+ months to develop a robust NFT infrastructure per chain.

### Running your own nodes is expensive 💸

Already only for Ethereum, you will run into a minimum of $84k/year in costs i.e. $2k-5k/month for cloud and $5K/month for engineering time. Using hosted node providers is even more expensive as you need to retreive all the historical NFT data.

### Non-infrastructure first providers are a risky bet 🎰

Using heavily rate-limited APIs is risky because if the service provider is not an infrastructure first company, they can change their business strategy and limit or turn off their APIs, leaving your project being shut down.

### Speed matters in this market 🚀

Being leapfrogged by the competition in a fast moving NFT market is one of the top worries for many. Slow-to-deploy and -use APIs will hinder your go-to-market, thus you risk losing users, revenue and being displaced by the competition.

## NFTRainbow Core Products 🏳️‍🌈🍭
